## 🐰 Introduction

Directus is an open-source suite of software for managing content in projects of any size. Instances of the [Directus API](https://github.com/directus/api) allow you to easily connect SQL database content anywhere (websites, native apps, wearables, IoT devices, kiosks, etc) while the [Directus App](https://github.com/directus/app) allows non-technical users to intuitively manage that content. You can easily install a build of the full [Directus Suite](https://github.com/directus/directus) which includes the App, API, and all dependencies.

* **No Assumptions.** That’s our motto, and we mean it. It’s your content, your workflow, your stack, your servers, and your database – Directus stays out of the way.
* **Pure, decoupled content.** Directus stores all your data unaltered, in SQL databases designed by you. Connect to your data from anywhere everywhere.
* **Directus is a simple toolkit, not a one-size-fits-all behemoth.** Every aspect of the framework can be tailored, extended, or even bypassed if needed. Truly limitless.
* **Full internationalization.** Manage multilingual content in as many languages as your project needs. And for international teams, the Directus App itself supports translations.
