/**
 * An error representing a failure of an individual provider.
 *
 * This error class has special meaning to the {@link chain} method. If a
 * provider in the chain is rejected with an error, the chain will only proceed
 * to the next provider if the value of the `tryNextLink` property on the error
 * is truthy. This allows individual providers to halt the chain and also
 * ensures the chain will stop if an entirely unexpected error is encountered.
