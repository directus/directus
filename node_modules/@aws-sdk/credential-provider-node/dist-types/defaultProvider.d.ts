/**
 * Creates a credential provider that will attempt to find credentials from the
 * following sources (listed in order of precedence):
 *   * Environment variables exposed via `process.env`
 *   * SSO credentials from token cache
 *   * Web identity token credentials
 *   * Shared credentials and config ini files
 *   * The EC2/ECS Instance Metadata Service
 *
 * The default credential provider will invoke one provider at a time and only
 * continue to the next if no credentials have been located. For example, if
 * the process finds values defined via the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
 * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables, the files at
 * `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` will not be read, nor will any
 * messages be sent to the Instance Metadata Service.
