     *          operations.</p>
     *          <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to
     *          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session

     *          credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns
     *          the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed

     *             Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
     *          <p>When you create a role, you create two policies: A role trust policy that specifies
     *             <i>who</i> can assume the role and a permissions policy that specifies
     *             <i>what</i> can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal
     *          who is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p>
     *          <p>To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the
     *          role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is
     *          created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to
     *          users in the account. </p>
     *          <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that
     *          are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy
     *          that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other
     *          account.</p>
     *          <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the
     *          following:</p>
     *          <ul>
     *             <li>
     *                <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code>
     *                (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p>
     *             </li>
     *             <li>
     *                <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p>
     *             </li>
     *          </ul>
     *          <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based
     *          policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no
     *          additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and
     *          resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the

     *          scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for
     *          MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to
     *          assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
     *          authentication might look like the following example.</p>
     *          <p>
     *             <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code>

     *          <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services
     *          security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile
     *          devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term Amazon Web Services
     *          credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services
     *          that use long-term Amazon Web Services credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by
     *          using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of
     *             <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce
     *          temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security

     *          <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by
     *             <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the
     *          optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session.
     *          You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
     *          setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how
     *          to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the

     *          <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can
     *          be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot
     *          call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API
     *          operations.</p>
     *          <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to
     *          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
     *          policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies.
     *          The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
     *          characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new
     *          temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the
     *          role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary
     *          credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns
     *          the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
     *          by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see

     *          <note>
     *             <p>An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a
     *             packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit
     *             even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code>

     *
     *          <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When
     *          you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with the same key.</p>
     *          <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The
     *          administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific

     *          </p>
     *          <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have
     *          an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application
     *          can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is
     *          associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified
     *          in the role's trust policy. </p>
     *          <important>
     *             <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your

     *             the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally

     *          an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM
     *          user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to
     *          access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">IAM Best Practices</a> in the
     *             <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p>
     *          <p>
     *             <b>Session duration</b>
     *          </p>
     *          <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15
     *          minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is
     *          43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials obtained by using the Amazon Web Services account root
     *          user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p>
     *          <p>
     *             <b>Permissions</b>
     *          </p>
     *          <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any
     *          Amazon Web Services service except the following:</p>
     *          <ul>
     *             <li>
     *                <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. </p>
     *             </li>
     *             <li>
     *                <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>
     *             </li>
     *          </ul>
     *          <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to
     *          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
     *          policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies.
     *          The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
     *          characters.</p>
     *          <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the
     *          resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the
     *          session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session
     *          policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
     *          federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that
     *          are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session
     *             Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about
     *          using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken">GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>. </p>
     *          <p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If
     *          that policy specifically references the federated user session in the
     *             <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by
     *          the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the
     *          session policies.</p>
     *          <p>
     *             <b>Tags</b>
     *          </p>
     *          <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session
     *          tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the
     *             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
     *          <note>
     *             <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using
     *             a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID
     *             Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or
     *                <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the
     *                <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
     *          </note>
     *          <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The
     *          administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific
     *          session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags
     *             for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the
     *          <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
     *          <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you
     *          cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume
     *          that the user that you are federating has the
     *             <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the
     *             <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code>
     *          and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in
     *          the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>
