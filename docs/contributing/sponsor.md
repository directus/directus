# Sponsorship & Advocacy

Directus requires significant resources to build and maintain, especially as our community rapidly grows. If you'd like
to help keep development active, please consider supporting Directus through sponsorship or advocacy.

## Sponsorship

If you would like to help ensure Directus stays free, please consider providing financial support through
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/directus) for as little as $1/month.

There's a range of perks available, including access to an exclusive Discord channel.

## Advocacy

### GitHub Stars

As an open-source project, stars are a primary metric by which we measure our success. It only takes a few seconds to
head to the [Directus GitHub Repo](https://github.com/directus/directus) and click the star. With enough activity in a
short period of time, we get _even more exposure_ on GitHub's trending page!

### Social Posts

Engage with us on social media. Follow us! A quick post mentioning [@directus](https://twitter.com/directus) goes a long
way! _Plus, we re-tweet the team's favorite shout-outs to our followers._

### Testimonials

_One sentence._ Even that was a sentence and it was only two words! If you're a fan of Directus, we'd love to hear why
with a short endorsement... More importantly, potential new users _need to hear your testimonial_ to see if the product
is right for them! You can leave a short written or video testimonial [here](https://testimonial.to/directus).

### Reviews

The following popular rating platforms allow you to post your rating and testimonial publicly, which automatically gives
it more exposure.
