# Codebase Overview

> remains accessible.

## Monorepo

The primary Directus repository is located at [`directus/directus`](https://github.com/directus/directus) and houses the
Data Studio (Vue.js 3 w/ Composition API), API (Node.js), API Specification (OpenAPI), and other smaller packages used
internally. Directus follows a monorepo design similar to React or Babel â€” this page will outline our monorepo's design
and structure.

## The API (`/api`)

Contains the Directus API (REST+GraphQL), written in Node.js. The source code is located in `/api/src` and the below
folders are inside there.

| Folder         | Content                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/cli`         | The CLI commands and matching functions that the `directus` package ships with.                                                                                                                 |
| `/controllers` | Route handler controllers for the endpoints in the API.                                                                                                                                         |
| `/database`    | Database manipulation abstraction, system migrations, and system data. Also where you'd find the main query runner.                                                                             |
| `/errors`      | Classes for the different errors the API is expected to throw. Used to set the HTTP status and error codes.                                                                                     |
| `/middleware`  | Various (express) routing middleware. Includes things like cache-checker, authenticator, etc.                                                                                                   |
| `/services`    | Internal services. The main abstraction for interfacing with the data in the database. Both GraphQL and REST requests are "translated" to use these services as the main logic in the platform. |
| `/types`       | TypeScript types that are shared between the different parts of the API.                                                                                                                        |
| `/utils`       | Various utility functions.                                                                                                                                                                      |

## The Data Studio App (`/app`)

Contains the Directus Data Studio App, written in Vue.js 3 w/ the Composition API.

| Folder    | Content                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/public` | Assets that are included with the app, but not bundled. |
| `/src`    | App source code.                                        |

The source code is located in `/app/src` and the below folders are inside there.

| Folder         | Content                                                                                                                                                      |

| `/components`  | (Base) components that are used across the platform. Contains "basic building blocks" like button, input, etc.                                               |
| `/composables` | Reusable parts of reactive logic that can be used between Vue components. Includes things reactively calculating time from now, fetching a single item, etc. |
| `/directives`  | Custom Vue directives (e.g. `v-tooltip`).                                                                                                                    |
| `/displays`    | Components to display of data within the app.                                                                                                                |
| `/interfaces`  | The core-included interfaces that allow editing and viewing individual pieces of data.                                                                       |
| `/lang`        | Translations abstraction, and language files. The language yaml files are maintained through [Crowdin](https://locales.directus.io).                         |
| `/layouts`     | The core-included layouts that change the way items are represented inside the collection view                                                               |
| `/modules`     | The core-included modules that structure major parts the app.                                                                                                |

| `/routes`      | The routes in the app. Modules define their own routes, so this only includes the "system" things that don't belong to module, like login.                   |
| `/stores`      | [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev) based stores used for global state tracking.                                                                                  |
| `/styles`      | All general styles, css-vars, mixins and themes are stored inside here. Every component has their own component styles, these are just the global styles.    |
| `/types`       | TypeScript types that are shared between the different parts of the App.                                                                                     |

::: tip Component Library

Directus comes shipped with it's own [Vue Component Library](https://components.directus.io) that you can use to enrich
your extensions or when developing locally. These components can be used in any of the "app extensions", including
Interfaces, Displays, Modules, Layouts, and Panels.
