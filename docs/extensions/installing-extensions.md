# Installing Extensions

There are two possible ways to install extensions to your Directus instance:

1. Installing through NPM
2. Installing through the Extensions Folder

## Installing Through NPM

Extensions can be published to the NPM registry and installed to your Directus instance from there. This way you can
install an existing public extension as well as your own published extension. Before you begin, ensure you have a
[self-hosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on your system.

**1. Modify docker-compose.yml**

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file of your project and replace the `image` option with a `build` section:

```yaml-vue
image: directus/directus:{{ directus.version.major }}.x.y // [!code --]
build: // [!code ++]
  context: ./ // [!code ++]
```

This allows you to build a customized Docker Image with the added extensions.

**2. Create a Dockerfile**

At the root of your project, create a `Dockerfile` if one doesn't already exist and add the following:

```Dockerfile-vue
FROM directus/directus:{{ directus.version.major }}.x.y

USER root
RUN corepack enable \
 && corepack prepare pnpm@{{ directus.pnpmVersion }} --activate

USER node
RUN pnpm install directus-extension-package-name
```

::: tip Extension Name

Remember to replace `directus-extension-package-name` with the name of the extension you want to install. For example,
`directus-extension-myextension`.

:::

**3. Build the Docker Image**

Build your Docker image:

```bash
docker compose build
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

On startup, you'd see that Directus will automatically load any extension installed in the previous steps.

## Installing Through the Extensions Folder

To locally install extensions, copy the files generated by the `directus-extension build` command into the `extensions`
folder located at the root of your Directus project.

::: warning Configurable Folders

The path to the built extension as well as the extensions directory are configurable and may be located elsewhere.

:::

Before you begin, ensure you have a [self-hosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on
your system.

**1. Create an Extensions Folder**

At the root of your project, create an `extensions` folder if one doesn't already exist to house your extensions.

**2. Add your new extension into the extensions folder**

Move the `package.json` file along with the output from the `dist/` folder into a new folder in the extensions folder
you created earlier.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```
extensions/
  <extension-name>/
    dist/
      index.js
    package.json
  ...
```

**3. Update Docker Compose File**

Open your `docker-compose.yml` file and add a volume to mount your extensions folder into the Docker container:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./extensions:/directus/extensions/
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

You should see that your extension has been successfully loaded into the Docker container. Now, go ahead to customize
your extension by making changes to the `src` folder within your extension directory.

::: tip Automatically Reload Extensions

To automatically reload extensions every time you make a change, without having to restart Directus, in your
`docker-compose.yml` file, set `EXTENSIONS_AUTO_RELOAD=true`.
