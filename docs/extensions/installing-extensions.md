# Installing Extensions

There are 3 possible ways to install extensions to your Directus instance:

1. Installing through NPM
2. Installing through the Extensions Folder
3. Installing through the Marketplace

## Installing through NPM

Package extensions are essentially npm packages that can be installed from the npm registry. Before you begin, ensure
you have a [selfhosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on your system.

**1. Modify docker-compose.yml**

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file of your project and modify the build section:

```yaml
build:
  context: ./
```

This allows Docker to build your project with the necessary dependencies.

**2. Create a Dockerfile**

At the root of your project, create a `Dockerfile` if one doesn't already exist and add the following:

```Dockerfile
FROM directus/directus:latest

USER root
RUN corepack enable \
 && corepack prepare pnpm@8.3.1 --activate

USER node
RUN pnpm install directus-extension-package-name
```

::: tip Extension Name

Remember to replace `directus-extension-package-name` with the name of the extension you want to install. For example,
`directus-extension-myextension`.

:::

**3. Build the Docker Image**

Build your Docker image by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container by running:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

On startup, you'd see that Directus will automatically load any package extension installed into your Directus project
folder.

::: tip Automatically Reload Extensions

To automatically reload extensions every time you make a change, without having to restart Directus, in your
`docker-compose.yml` file, set `EXTENSIONS_AUTO_RELOAD=true`.

:::

## Installing Through the Extensions Folder

Local extensions are essentially the files generated by the `directus-extension build` command. They can be installed by
copying those files into the extensions folder at the root of your Directus project.

::: warning Configurable Folders

The path to the built extension as well as the extensions directory are configurable and may be located elsewhere.

:::

Before you begin, ensure you have a [selfhosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on
your system.

**1. Create an Extension Folder**

At the root of your project, create an "extensions" folder if one doesn't already exist to house your extension.

**2. Add your new extension into the extensions folder**

Move the output from the `dist/` folder into the extensions folder you created earlier.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```yaml
extensions/
	<extension-name>/
			dist/
        index.js
      src
        index.js
        interface.vue
	displays/
	hooks/
	endpoints/
  ...
```

::: tip Extension Name Format

Ensure your extension is prefixed with `directus-extension`. For example, `directus-extension-myextension`.

:::

**3. Update Docker Compose File**

Open your `docker-compose.yml` file with the following to mount your extension into the Docker container:

```yaml
volumes:

  - ./extensions:/directus/extensions/
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container by running:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should see that your extension has been successfully loaded into the Docker container. Now, go ahead to customize
your extension by making changes to the src folder within your extension directory.

## Installing through the Marketplace

Within your [Directus Cloud account](https://directus.cloud), you can conveniently install extensions from the Directus
Marketplace.

**1. Access the Marketplace**

Log in to your Directus cloud account. Once logged in, navigate to the "Marketplace" menu from the Module Bar.

**2. Install Extensions**

Within the Directus Marketplace, you'll notice a list of extensions that can be integrated into your account. Search for
an extension that suits your needs and install it.

::: tip Admin Access

Only Administrators of a Directus instance can install extensions.
