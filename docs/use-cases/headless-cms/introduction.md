# Headless CMS

> {{ $frontmatter.description }}

A [Headless CMS](https://directus.io/solutions/headless-cms) provides a way of managing content for websites, mobile
apps, and other digital applications. It separates the content from the presentation layer, allowing developers to
create the frontend of a website or app with whatever technology they choose. With a Headless CMS, content can be
created and managed in one place, and allows any number of applications built upon that data.
