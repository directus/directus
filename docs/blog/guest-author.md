# Guest Authors

Our guest author program invites authors to join and get paid to write tutorials for the Directus community. We accept
new guest authors into the program periodically via application form.

Once you have been invited to join the program, you will be able to see all of the posts we want created and can
indicate which tutorials you are interested in writing.

## How Does It Work?

1. Submit an application via form to become a guest author.
2. Our team reviews applications periodically and admits authors based on the current technical needs of our author
   profiles.
3. We onboard authors and share more about the tutorial assigning process, which happens in GitHub.
4. We release tutorials we’d like to see written and assign a budget per tutorial within each tutorial’s details.
5. Authors say which tutorials they’d like to work on and we assign them on a monthly basis.
6. Once a tutorial is assigned to a guest author, they manage, write and submit it via GitHub for a review.
7. Once reviewed and accepted, the guest authors upload their tutorial into our Directus backend ready for the Directus
   team to publish it.

This process ensures that we work with you to create the best possible content, while also ensuring that the content
fits within our publication needs.
