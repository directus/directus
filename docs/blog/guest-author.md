## How Does It Work?

This process ensures that we work with you to create the best possible content, while also ensuring that the content fits within our publication guidelines.

1. Submit an idea for an original piece of written content.
2. Collaborate with our team to finalize the idea.
3. Draft the first version of the content.
4. Review the draft with our team.
5. Revise the content based on feedback.
6. Publish the final version on our developer blog and get paid up to $500.

## What Ideas Are Accepted?

We may change the scope over time, but for now, we are interested in:

- Tutorials that use Directus such as “Build A Budgeting Application With Directus”.
- Examples of applications using Directus with various environments and frameworks such as “Build an iOS App With Directus”.
- Tutorials that extend default functionality, such as “Creating An Extension To Send Stripe Invoices”.
- Advanced-level tutorials explaining how to use one or more Directus features.

## Questions

:::details How much will I get paid?
  We have three tiers of content payment, dependent on the time and effort required - $200, $350, and $500. The value is agreed upon before any writing happens and is at the discretion of Directus.
:::

:::details How long should posts be?
  We’re flexible, and this is reflected in our multi-tier payment structure. Posts must be completed in one part (no multi-part series), and be over 1000 words.
:::

:::details How long does it take?
  Once agreed, we love to move quickly through drafting, reviewing, and publishing. We expect each post to take somewhere between 2-4 weeks to go through this whole process.
:::

:::details Can I write a piece that promotes another product?
  If you work for a company that makes the product, our relationship might be better served as a co-marketing effort. For the Guest Author program, we only work with individuals.

  We currently only accept contributions in English.
:::

:::details Can I post elsewhere?
  Yes, but must include our post as the canonical source for the content.

  You own your content, but you grant us an unlimited license to post and promote your content.
