# Packages TypeDocs

Welcome to the Directus Packages TypeDocs!

Here you will find comprehensive documentation for each package in the Directus ecosystem.

TypeDocs provide detailed information about the TypeScript types, interfaces, functions, and more available in each
package.

Whether you are developing custom extensions, building integrations, or extending Directus functionality, the TypeDocs
will guide you through the available APIs and help you write type-safe code.
