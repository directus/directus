# Platform Overview

Directus is a Composable Data Platform built to democratize data. Connect it to your database, asset storage, and external services, and immediately receive rich developer tooling (Data Engine) and an intuitive and approachable web application (Data Studio) to work with your data. Granular and powerful access control means users can only see, interact, and create data allowed by their role used by both the Engine and Studio.

## Use Cases

### Backend as a Service

Tools that developers need to build success applications - autogenerated APIs, event or schedule-based automations, user management and authentication, realtime, and webhooks.

### Headless CMS

Remember, *content* is just data from a database. Manage your files and data, delivering it across websites, apps, kiosks, digital signage, or any other data-driven application.

### Internal Tool Builder

Using Directus Insights, your whole team can build custom applications. Ditch the spreadsheet and quickly build back-office apps and admin panels for customers, inventory, projects, or reporting*.*

### Data Management and Analytics

Establish a single source of truth for all data. Build no-code analytics dashboards to gain insights into company KPIs and other metrics. Coalesce previously siloed data and use Directus Automate to keep everything in sync.
