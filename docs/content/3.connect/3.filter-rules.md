# Filter Rules

Filters are used in permissions, validations, and automations, as well as throughout the APIs and in extensions. All filters use standard syntax and operators which are described on this page.

## Available Operators

## Filter Syntax

```json
{
	"field": {
		"operator": "value"
	}
}
```

The `field` can exist on the current collection or a relational collection.

The `operator` must be any valid filter operator such as as 'equals' or 'contains'.

The `value` can be any fixed static value or one of the provided dynamic variables.

::callout{type="info" title="Example"}
This filter checks the `title` field contains the case-sensitive substring 'Directus':
```json
{
	"title": {
		"_contains": "Directus"
	}
}
```
::

## Relational Fields

<!-- TODO: IMAGE - DATA STUDIO -->

You can specify related values by nesting field names. For example, if you have a relational Many to One `author` field, and want to specify a filter on the author's `name` field:

<!-- TODO: GENERIC EXAMPLE -->
```json
{
	"authors": {
		"authors_id": {
			"name": {
				"_eq": "Rijk van Zanten"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

When applying filters to a One to Many field, Directus will default to a 'some' search.

::callout{type="info" title="Example"}
This filter checks all related category names and will check is at least one value is equal to 'Recipe':
```json
{
	"categories": {
		"name": {
			"_eq": "Recipe"
		}
	}
}
```
::
This behavior can be overridden by using the explicit `_some` and `_none` operators.

::callout{type="info" title="Example"}
```json
{
	"categories": {
		"_none": {
			"name": {
				"_eq": "Recipe"
			}
		}
	}
}
```
::

## Dynamic Variables

| Variable             | Description                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$CURRENT_USER`      | The primary key of the currently authenticated user.                                             |
| `$CURRENT_ROLE`      | The primary key of the role for the currently authenticated user                                 |
| `$NOW`               | The current timestamp                                                                            |
| `$NOW(<adjustment>)` | The current timestamp plus/minus a given distance, for example `$NOW(-1 year)`, `$NOW(+2 hours)` |

::callout{type="info" title="Examples"}
	::tabs
		::tab{label="$CURRENT_USER"}
		```json
		{
			"owner": {
				"_eq": "$CURRENT_USER"
			}
		}
		```
		::

		::tab{label="$NOW"}
		```json
		{
			"datetime": {
				"_lte": "$NOW"
			}
		}
		```
		::
	::
::

::callout{type="info" title="Nested user and role variables in permissions"}
When configuring permissions, `$CURRENT_USER` and `$CURRENT_ROLE` allow you to specify any related field, such as `$CURRENT_ROLE.name` or `$CURRENT_USER.avatar.filesize`.
::

## Logical Operators

<!-- TODO: IMAGE - DATA STUDIO -->

You can group multiple rules using the `_and` or `_or` logical operators. Each logical operator holds an array of filter rules. Logical operators can be nested directly inside of each other, but not inside of other filter rules.

```json
{
	"_and": [
		{
			"field": {
				"operator": "value"
			}
		},
		{
			"field": {
				"operator": "value"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

::callout{type="info" title="Example"}
```json
{
	"_or": [
		{
			"_and": [
				{
					"user_created": {
						"_eq": "$CURRENT_USER"
					}
				},
				{
					"status": {
						"_in": ["published", "draft"]
					}
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"_and": [
				{
					"user_created": {
						"_neq": "$CURRENT_USER"
					}
				},
				{
					"status": {
						"_in": ["published"]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```
::

## Functions Parameters

:partial{content="query-functions"}

::callout{type="info" title="Example"}
```js
{
	_and: [
		{
			"year(published_date)": {
				_eq: 1968,
			},
		},
		{
			"month(published_date)": {
				_eq: 4,
			},
		},
	],
},
```
