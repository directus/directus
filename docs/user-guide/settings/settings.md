Only Administrators have access to the Settings Module.

Settings are split into five distinct sections, each described below.

- [Project Settings](/user-guide/cloud/project-settings) — Setup branding and other global style options.
- [Data Model](/app/data-model) — Create and modify [Collections](/user-guide/overview/glossary#collections),
  [Relationships](/user-guide/overview/glossary#relationships), form layout, and [Fields](/user-guide/overview/glossary#fields).
- [Roles & Permissions](/user-guide/user-management/users-roles-permissions) — Create and manage access via Roles and Permissions.
- [Presets & Bookmarks](/user-guide/settings/presets-bookmarks) — Set default views of data and configure bookmarks.
- [Webhooks](/app/webhooks) — Use platform events to trigger external services.

Aside from the above pages, there are three shorthand links:

- **Report Bug**\
  A direct link to report a bug in the platform. When using this button, helpful debugging information about your project
  is automatically included, such as: version number, operating system, and environment type.

- **Request Feature**\
  A direct link to [submit a new feature request](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/new) on GitHub. Feature
  requests are a great way to let our team know what should be prioritized next. Learn more about making feature requests
  in the [Contributing > Introduction](/contributing/introduction#feature-requests).

- **Platform Version**\
  Displays the exact version of your platform. Click this button to go to the GitHub releases page, which includes the full
  change logs.
