::: tip Import / Export via the API

This page details Importing and Exporting of Items as files via the no-code app. However, you can also
[Import](/reference/system/utilities#import-data-from-file) and
[Export](/reference/system/utilities#export-data-to-a-file) Items as files programmatically via the API.

To import Items from a file, follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to the desired Module and Collection.\
   Note: the User Directory and File Library are each composed of just one Collection.
2. Click **"Import / Export"** in the Sidebar.
3. Click into the import search box. A file browser will open.
4. Select the desired file and click **"open"**.
5. Click **"Start Import"** to import the Items.

The Items will now be in the Collection. The file itself will not be stored in the Directus Project.

::: tip Supported File Formats

You can import data from CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, and XLS files. When importing from XLS files, the first sheet will be used by default.

:::

::: tip Importing Relational Files

It is possible to import relational Field values as well. For this task, the User performing the import will need access
permissions for the related Collection and a firm understanding of the relational data model.

When exporting Items, the [Export Items Menu](#export-items-menu) provides granular control over exactly which Items and
Fields are exported, how they are exported, and where they are exported. To export Items, follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to the desired Module and Collection.\
   Note: the User Directory and File Library are each composed of one Collection.
2. Click **"Import / Export"** in the Sidebar.

::: tip Opening the file in Excel?

Export your file to CSV or XLS to seamlessly open in Excel. XLS format provides better compatibility with Excel's features and formatting.

:::

::: tip Exporting to File Library

When downloading 2,500 or more Items, you will be required to download into the Directus Project's File Library. After
exporting, go to the File Library to download your file locally.

:::

::: tip Exporting Relational Files

It is possible to export relational Field values. For this task, the User performing the export will need access
permissions for the related Collection and a firm understanding of the relational data model.
