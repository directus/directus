## How it Works

	<source src="https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/app-guide/display-templates/display-templates-20220523A/set-display-templates-20220523A.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

Display Templates can be found in various places all throughout the App, such as
[Layout Options](/user-guide/content-module/layouts) and the [List Panel](/user-guide/insights/dashboards#lists) in
Insights. Display Templates are easy to setup, just follow these steps:

- Click <span mi icon>add_box</span> to add a Field or relationally linked Field.
- Type in any custom text as desired.
- Click the Field inline or hit `backspace` to remove it.

::: tip Keep it Short and Simple

Display Templates will let you represent Items with custom inline text, image thumbnails, dates, numbers, or pretty
anything else. However, it may look funky or run off the page if you attempt to display things like long blog posts,
JSON objects or geo-coordinates.
