# Documentation

> An internal set of guides and docs for the installed version of the platform, including an
> [API Reference](/reference/api/introduction) that is dynamically tailored to your custom schema.

Docs for the latest version of the platform are available via [https://docs.directus.io](https://docs.directus.io), and
_version-specific_ docs are included within the App itself as a core module. Both sets come from the same source of
markdown files on [GitHub](https://github.com/directus/directus), making them easy for anyone to work with.

Below are the six main sections of the platform's documentation, as well as descriptions of each.

- [Getting Started](/getting-started/introduction/) — For anyone who is unfamiliar with the platform
- [App Guide](/app-guide/introduction/) — For users (non-technical or technical) of the platform's no-code App
- [Configuration](/configuration/introduction/) — For administrators installing and setting up the platform
- [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction/) — For developers connecting with data via the platform's API toolkit
- [Extensions](/extensions/introduction/) — For developers creating custom experiences on top of the platform
- [Contributing](/contributing/introduction/) — For developers working on the platform's open-source core

::: tip In-App Exclusions

Docs included within the app intentionally exclude certain pages, such as "Installation", as these sections are not
relevant to running instances of the platform. Additionally, some sections may be hidden based on your role as a user
versus a more technical administrator.
