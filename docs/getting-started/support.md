# Help & Support

> If you have questions while working with Directus, there are many resources to help you get up-and-running smoothly.

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're experiencing issues or think you have found a problem in Directus, be sure to follow these steps before
[Reporting a Bug](/contributing/introduction#report-a-bug):

1. Ensure your server and database meet the [minimum requirements](/self-hosted/docker-guide#supported-databases).
2. Ensure youâ€™re on the [latest version](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/latest) of Directus.
3. Stop `CTRL+C` and restart the server `npx directus start`.
4. Run the database migration script: `directus database migrate:latest`\
   _Note: backup your database first._
5. Disable any data-caching within your project.
6. Test any app issues with both browser extensions and caching disabled _(i.e. Incognito Mode)_.
7. Confirm the issue is not related to your own custom code.
8. Check for [existing Issues](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues?q=is%3Aissue) (and
   [Discussions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions)) that match your problem.

If you're still experiencing a problem after completing the above steps, you can chat through things on our
[community support](#community-support) or [report a bug](/contributing/introduction#report-a-bug).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Directus support Mongo/NoSQL?

Not currently. Directus has been built specifically for wrapping _relational_ databases. While we could force Mongo to
use tables, columns, and rows via Mongoose object modeling, that approach of "faking" a relational structure in a
non-structured environment like Mongo doesn't make a lot of sense. We do realize many users are interested in this
feature, and will continue to explore its possibility.

### Why haven't you added this feature, or fixed that issue yet?

Directus is an open-source project, maintained by a small core team and community contributors who have limited time and
resources.

Our platform is feature-rich, however not every suggested feature is right for the core codebase. We rely on extensions
to include new functionality that might not be relevant for 80%+ of our user base. Directus is also quite stable,
however new issues still arise, some of which may be triaged with a lower prioritization.

### Can you give an ETA for this feature/fix?

If it is sponsored work, then yes, delivery dates are part of our statement of work agreements. Otherwise, most likely
not. This is open-source software, work is prioritized internally, and all timelines are subject to change.

### But this is an emergency, my very important project requires it now!

We understand, and are here to help. If you need something prioritized, you can reach out to us to discuss
[premium support](#basic-and-premium-support).
