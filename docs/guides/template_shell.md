### Descriptive Title for Part 1

Optional intro. If you add one, try to keep it to about a paragraph.

1. Do A
2. Do B
3. Do C

Here, you may need to add some details about the expected result before moving on to Part 2 (if you have a part 2).

### Descriptive Title for Part 2

Once Part 1 is over, follow these steps.

1. Do D
2. Do E
3. Do F

If there's a part 3, write it! If not, you're done!

## Final Tips

This is where you expand and solidify your reader's understanding of the recipe. It's where you fill in the gaps that
would be overwhelming or hard to follow in the previous sections.
