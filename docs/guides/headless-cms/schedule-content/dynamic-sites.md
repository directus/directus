# Schedule Future Content for Dynamic Sites

<GuideMeta />

## Explanation

This guide explains how to schedule content to be published on a future date for dynamic sites when using Directus as a
[Headless CMS](https://directus.io/solutions/headless-cms).

Scheduling content has fewer steps for a dynamic site. Since you are calling your Directus API at the time that a
visitor requests a page from your site, all you need to do is add a filter to your query.

::: info Note

If your site is statically generated and your content fetched at build time, please
[follow the guide for static sites](/guides/headless-cms/schedule-content/static-sites).

:::

## How-To Guide

::: tip Requirements

Youâ€™ll need to have already created a collection for your site content like `articles` or `posts` or `pages` with a
field `status` that controls the published state.

:::

### Add a Field To Control Publish Date and Time

1. Under Settings, go to Data Model.

2. Choose your content [Collection](/app/data-model/collections).

3. [Add a new field](/app/data-model/fields#create-a-field-standard) to your content Collection.

   ![The interface for creating a new field is shown. The field type Datetime is selected. The Key is named date_published. The field for Use 24-Hour format is checked.](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/headless-cms/how-to-packet-20220222A/scheduling-content-publish-date-timestamp.webp)

   a. Choose **Timestamp** for the Type.

   b. Name the Key `date_published`.

   c. Save the Field and your Collection.

### Add Some Content and Set a Publish Date

4. [Create or update an Item](/user-guide/content-module/content/items) inside your Collection

   ![A content item within the Articles collection is shown. The title is "What is Headless CMS?". English translations are also shown with a Summary field. The Summary reads "A quick overview of what Headless CMS is and how it's beneficial to your team."](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/headless-cms/how-to-packet-20220222A/scheduling-content-create-content-published.webp)

   a. Set the `status` field to `published`

   b. Add a date for the `date_published` field

   c. Add the content for other fields and save the Item

### Check the Published Date When Calling the Directus API

- When calling the API, add a [filter rule](/reference/filter-rules) that checks the `date_published` field.
- Use the `_lte` operator to filter for dates that are less than or equal the current date/time.
- You can use the [dynamic variable](/reference/filter-rules#dynamic-variables) `$NOW` to get the current timestamp.

#### Examples

::: tip

In these examples, we're using an [AND logical operator](/reference/filter-rules#logical-operators) to only return
records that match both conditions. This provides a little more control over your published content by ensuring only
articles that have a publish date AND have the `published` state are displayed on your site.

:::

Using the [Directus JavaScript SDK](/guides/sdk/getting-started) (preferred)

```js
// Initialize the SDK.
import { createDirectus, rest, readItems } from '@directus/sdk';

const directus = createDirectus('https://directus.example.com').with(rest());

const articles = await directus.request(
	readItems('articles', {
		filter: {
			_and: [
				{
					status: {
						_eq: 'published',
					},
				},
				{
					date_published: {
						_lte: '$NOW',
					},
				},
			],
		},
	})
);
```

Using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) (JavaScript)

```js
const response = await fetch(
	'https://yourdirectusurl.com/items/articles?' +
		new URLSearchParams({
			filter: {
				_and: [
					{
						status: {
							_eq: 'published',
						},
					},
					{
						date_published: {
							_lte: '$NOW',
						},
					},
				],
			},
		})
);

const articles = await response.json();
```

## Final Tips

**Tips**

- If you're not receiving the data you expect, double-check your [filter rule](/reference/filter-rules) syntax.
- Also be sure you have enabled the proper permissions for your content Collection.
