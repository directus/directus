# Extensions

> In addition to being highly customizable, Directus has also been built with many modular extension points throughout
> the App and API.

## App Extensions

Directus has been architected as completely modular and extensible, with four keystone App component types.
Out-of-the-box components are configurable, or altogether new components can be created as extensions.

- [Modules](/concepts/modules/)
- [Layouts](/concepts/layouts/)
- [Interfaces](/concepts/interfaces/)
- [Displays](/concepts/displays/)

## API Extensions

- [Endpoints](/guides/api-endpoints)
- [Hooks](/guides/api-hooks)
