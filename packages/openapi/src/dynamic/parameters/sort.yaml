  How to sort the returned items. `sort` is a CSV of fields used to sort the fetched items. Sorting defaults to
  ascending (ASC) order but a minus sign (` - `) can be used to reverse this to descending (DESC) order. Fields are
  prioritized by their order in the CSV. You can also use a ` ? ` to sort randomly.
