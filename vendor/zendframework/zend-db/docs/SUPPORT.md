# Getting Support

Zend Framework offers three support channels:

- For real-time questions, use our
  [Slack](https://zendframework-slack.herokuapp.com)
- For detailed questions (e.g., those requiring examples) use our
  [forums](https://discourse.zendframework.com/c/questions/components)
- To report issues, use this repository's
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/issues/new)

**DO NOT** use the issue tracker to ask questions; use Slack or the forums for
that. Questions posed to the issue tracker will be closed.

When reporting an issue, please include the following details:

- A narrative description of what you are trying to accomplish.
- The minimum code necessary to reproduce the issue.
- The expected results of exercising that code.
- The actual results received.

We may ask for additional details: what version of the library you are using,
and what PHP version was used to reproduce the issue.

You may also submit a failing test case as a pull request.
