# php-token-stream

## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require phpunit/php-token-stream

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

    composer require --dev phpunit/php-token-stream
