## 6.0.2 - 2015-07-04

* Fixed a memory leak in the curl handlers in which references to callbacks
  were not being removed by `curl_reset`.
* Cookies are now extracted properly before redirects.
* Cookies now allow more character ranges.
* Decoded Content-Encoding responses are now modified to correctly reflect
  their state if the encoding was automatically removed by a handler. This
  means that the `Content-Encoding` header may be removed an the
  `Content-Length` modified to reflect the message size after removing the
  encoding.
* Added a more explicit error message when trying to use `form_params` and
  `multipart` in the same request.
* Several fixes for HHVM support.
* Functions are now conditionally required using an additional level of
  indirection to help with global Composer installations.

## 6.0.1 - 2015-05-27

* Fixed a bug with serializing the `query` request option where the `&`
  separator was missing.
* Added a better error message for when `body` is provided as an array. Please
  use `form_params` or `multipart` instead.
* Various doc fixes.

## 6.0.0 - 2015-05-26

* See the UPGRADING.md document for more information.
* Added `multipart` and `form_params` request options.
* Added `synchronous` request option.
* Added the `on_headers` request option.
* Fixed `expect` handling.
* No longer adding default middlewares in the client ctor. These need to be
  present on the provided handler in order to work.
* Requests are no longer initiated when sending async requests with the
  CurlMultiHandler. This prevents unexpected recursion from requests completing
  while ticking the cURL loop.
* Removed the semantics of setting `default` to `true`. This is no longer
  required now that the cURL loop is not ticked for async requests.
* Added request and response logging middleware.
* No longer allowing self signed certificates when using the StreamHandler.
* Ensuring that `sink` is valid if saving to a file.
* Request exceptions now include a "handler context" which provides handler
  specific contextual information.
* Added `GuzzleHttp\RequestOptions` to allow request options to be applied
  using constants.
* `$maxHandles` has been removed from CurlMultiHandler.
* `MultipartPostBody` is now part of the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package.

## 5.3.0 - 2015-05-19

* Mock now supports `save_to`
* Marked `AbstractRequestEvent::getTransaction()` as public.
* Fixed a bug in which multiple headers using different casing would overwrite
  previous headers in the associative array.
* Added `Utils::getDefaultHandler()`
* Marked `GuzzleHttp\Client::getDefaultUserAgent` as deprecated.
* URL scheme is now always lowercased.

## 6.0.0-beta.1

* Requires PHP >= 5.5
* Updated to use PSR-7
  * Requires immutable messages, which basically means an event based system
    owned by a request instance is no longer possible.
  * Utilizing the [Guzzle PSR-7 package](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7).
  * Removed the dependency on `guzzlehttp/streams`. These stream abstractions
    are available in the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package under the `GuzzleHttp\Psr7`
    namespace.
* Added middleware and handler system
  * Replaced the Guzzle event and subscriber system with a middleware system.
  * No longer depends on RingPHP, but rather places the HTTP handlers directly
    in Guzzle, operating on PSR-7 messages.
  * Retry logic is now encapsulated in `GuzzleHttp\Middleware::retry`, which
    means the `guzzlehttp/retry-subscriber` is now obsolete.
  * Mocking responses is now handled using `GuzzleHttp\Handler\MockHandler`.
* Asynchronous responses
  * No longer supports the `future` request option to send an async request.
    Instead, use one of the `*Async` methods of a client (e.g., `requestAsync`,
    `getAsync`, etc.).
  * Utilizing `GuzzleHttp\Promise` instead of React's promise library to avoid
    recursion required by chaining and forwarding react promises. See
    https://github.com/guzzle/promises
  * Added `requestAsync` and `sendAsync` to send request asynchronously.
  * Added magic methods for `getAsync()`, `postAsync()`, etc. to send requests
    asynchronously.
* Request options
  * POST and form updates
    * Added the `form_fields` and `form_files` request options.
    * Removed the `GuzzleHttp\Post` namespace.
    * The `body` request option no longer accepts an array for POST requests.
  * The `exceptions` request option has been deprecated in favor of the
    `http_errors` request options.
  * The `save_to` request option has been deprecated in favor of `sink` request
    option.
* Clients no longer accept an array of URI template string and variables for
  URI variables. You will need to expand URI templates before passing them
  into a client constructor or request method.
* Client methods `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `options()`, etc. are
  now magic methods that will send synchronous requests.
* Replaced `Utils.php` with plain functions in `functions.php`.
* Removed `GuzzleHttp\Collection`.
* Removed `GuzzleHttp\BatchResults`. Batched pool results are now returned as
  an array.
* Removed `GuzzleHttp\Query`. Query string handling is now handled using an
  associative array passed into the `query` request option. The query string
  is serialized using PHP's `http_build_query`. If you need more control, you
  can pass the query string in as a string.
* `GuzzleHttp\QueryParser` has been replaced with the
  `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\parse_query`.

## 5.2.0 - 2015-01-27

* Added `AppliesHeadersInterface` to make applying headers to a request based
  on the body more generic and not specific to `PostBodyInterface`.
* Reduced the number of stack frames needed to send requests.
* Nested futures are now resolved in the client rather than the RequestFsm
* Finishing state transitions is now handled in the RequestFsm rather than the
  RingBridge.
* Added a guard in the Pool class to not use recursion for request retries.

## 5.1.0 - 2014-12-19

* Pool class no longer uses recursion when a request is intercepted.
* The size of a Pool can now be dynamically adjusted using a callback.
  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/943.
* Setting a request option to `null` when creating a request with a client will
  ensure that the option is not set. This allows you to overwrite default
  request options on a per-request basis.
  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/937.
* Added the ability to limit which protocols are allowed for redirects by
  specifying a `protocols` array in the `allow_redirects` request option.
* Nested futures due to retries are now resolved when waiting for synchronous
  responses. See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/947.
* `"0"` is now an allowed URI path. See
  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/935.
* `Query` no longer typehints on the `$query` argument in the constructor,
  allowing for strings and arrays.
* Exceptions thrown in the `end` event are now correctly wrapped with Guzzle
  specific exceptions if necessary.

## 5.0.3 - 2014-11-03

This change updates query strings so that they are treated as un-encoded values
by default where the value represents an un-encoded value to send over the
wire. A Query object then encodes the value before sending over the wire. This
means that even value query string values (e.g., ":") are url encoded. This
makes the Query class match PHP's http_build_query function. However, if you
want to send requests over the wire using valid query string characters that do
not need to be encoded, then you can provide a string to Url::setQuery() and
pass true as the second argument to specify that the query string is a raw
string that should not be parsed or encoded (unless a call to getQuery() is
subsequently made, forcing the query-string to be converted into a Query
object).

## 5.0.2 - 2014-10-30

* Added a trailing `\r\n` to multipart/form-data payloads. See
  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/871
* Added a `GuzzleHttp\Pool::send()` convenience method to match the docs.
* Status codes are now returned as integers. See
  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/881
* No longer overwriting an existing `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header
  when sending POST requests, allowing for customized headers. See
  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/877
* Improved path URL serialization.

  * No longer double percent-encoding characters in the path or query string if
    they are already encoded.
  * Now properly encoding the supplied path to a URL object, instead of only
    encoding ' ' and '?'.
  * Note: This has been changed in 5.0.3 to now encode query string values by
    default unless the `rawString` argument is provided when setting the query
    string on a URL: Now allowing many more characters to be present in the
    query string without being percent encoded. See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A

## 5.0.1 - 2014-10-16

Bugfix release.

* Fixed an issue where connection errors still returned response object in
  error and end events event though the response is unusable. This has been
  corrected so that a response is not returned in the `getResponse` method of
  these events if the response did not complete. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/867
* Fixed an issue where transfer statistics were not being populated in the
  RingBridge. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/866

## 5.0.0 - 2014-10-12

Adding support for non-blocking responses and some minor API cleanup.

### New Features

* Added support for non-blocking responses based on `guzzlehttp/guzzle-ring`.
* Added a public API for creating a default HTTP adapter.
* Updated the redirect plugin to be non-blocking so that redirects are sent
  concurrently. Other plugins like this can now be updated to be non-blocking.
* Added a "progress" event so that you can get upload and download progress
  events.
* Added `GuzzleHttp\Pool` which implements FutureInterface and transfers
  requests concurrently using a capped pool size as efficiently as possible.
* Added `hasListeners()` to EmitterInterface.
* Removed `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface::sendAll` and marked
  `GuzzleHttp\Client::sendAll` as deprecated (it's still there, just not the
  recommended way).

### Breaking changes

The breaking changes in this release are relatively minor. The biggest thing to
look out for is that request and response objects no longer implement fluent
interfaces.

* Removed the fluent interfaces (i.e., `return $this`) from requests,
  responses, `GuzzleHttp\Collection`, `GuzzleHttp\Url`,
  `GuzzleHttp\Query`, `GuzzleHttp\Post\PostBody`, and
  `GuzzleHttp\Cookie\SetCookie`. This blog post provides a good outline of
  why I did this: http://ocramius.github.io/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil/.
  This also makes the Guzzle message interfaces compatible with the current
  PSR-7 message proposal.
* Removed "functions.php", so that Guzzle is truly PSR-4 compliant. Except
  for the HTTP request functions from function.php, these functions are now
  implemented in `GuzzleHttp\Utils` using camelCase. `GuzzleHttp\json_decode`
  moved to `GuzzleHttp\Utils::jsonDecode`. `GuzzleHttp\get_path` moved to
  `GuzzleHttp\Utils::getPath`. `GuzzleHttp\set_path` moved to
  `GuzzleHttp\Utils::setPath`. `GuzzleHttp\batch` should now be
  `GuzzleHttp\Pool::batch`, which returns an `objectStorage`. Using functions.php
  caused problems for many users: they aren't PSR-4 compliant, require an
  explicit include, and needed an if-guard to ensure that the functions are not
  declared multiple times.
* Rewrote adapter layer.
    * Removing all classes from `GuzzleHttp\Adapter`, these are now
      implemented as callables that are stored in `GuzzleHttp\Ring\Client`.
    * Removed the concept of "parallel adapters". Sending requests serially or
      concurrently is now handled using a single adapter.
    * Moved `GuzzleHttp\Adapter\Transaction` to `GuzzleHttp\Transaction`. The
      Transaction object now exposes the request, response, and client as public
      properties. The getters and setters have been removed.
* Removed the "headers" event. This event was only useful for changing the
  body a response once the headers of the response were known. You can implement
  a similar behavior in a number of ways. One example might be to use a
  FnStream that has access to the transaction being sent. For example, when the
  first byte is written, you could check if the response headers match your
  expectations, and if so, change the actual stream body that is being
  written to.
* Removed the `asArray` parameter from
  `GuzzleHttp\Message\MessageInterface::getHeader`. If you want to get a header
  value as an array, then use the newly added `getHeaderAsArray()` method of
  `MessageInterface`. This change makes the Guzzle interfaces compatible with
  the PSR-7 interfaces.
* `GuzzleHttp\Message\MessageFactory` no longer allows subclasses to add
  custom request options using double-dispatch (this was an implementation
  detail). Instead, you should now provide an associative array to the
  constructor which is a mapping of the request option name mapping to a
  function that applies the option value to a request.
* Removed the concept of "throwImmediately" from exceptions and error events.
  This control mechanism was used to stop a transfer of concurrent requests
  from completing. This can now be handled by throwing the exception or by
  cancelling a pool of requests or each outstanding future request individually.
* Updated to "GuzzleHttp\Streams" 3.0.
    * `GuzzleHttp\Stream\StreamInterface::getContents()` no longer accepts a
      `maxLen` parameter. This update makes the Guzzle streams project
      compatible with the current PSR-7 proposal.
    * `GuzzleHttp\Stream\Stream::__construct`,
      `GuzzleHttp\Stream\Stream::factory`, and
      `GuzzleHttp\Stream\Utils::create` no longer accept a size in the second
      argument. They now accept an associative array of options, including the
      "size" key and "metadata" key which can be used to provide custom metadata.

## 4.2.2 - 2014-09-08

* Fixed a memory leak in the CurlAdapter when reusing cURL handles.
* No longer using `request_fulluri` in stream adapter proxies.
* Relative redirects are now based on the last response, not the first response.

## 4.2.1 - 2014-08-19

* Ensuring that the StreamAdapter does not always add a Content-Type header
* Adding automated github releases with a phar and zip

## 4.2.0 - 2014-08-17

* Now merging in default options using a case-insensitive comparison.
  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/767
* Added the ability to automatically decode `Content-Encoding` response bodies
  using the `decode_content` request option. This is set to `true` by default
  to decode the response body if it comes over the wire with a
  `Content-Encoding`. Set this value to `false` to disable decoding the
  response content, and pass a string to provide a request `Accept-Encoding`
  header and turn on automatic response decoding. This feature now allows you
  to pass an `Accept-Encoding` header in the headers of a request but still
  disable automatic response decoding.
  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/764
* Added the ability to throw an exception immediately when transferring
  requests in parallel. Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/760
* Updating guzzlehttp/streams dependency to ~2.1
* No longer utilizing the now deprecated namespaced methods from the stream
  package.

## 4.1.8 - 2014-08-14

* Fixed an issue in the CurlFactory that caused setting the `stream=false`
  request option to throw an exception.
  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/769
* TransactionIterator now calls rewind on the inner iterator.
  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/765
* You can now set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`
  when creating POST requests to force multipart bodies.
  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/768

## 4.1.7 - 2014-08-07

* Fixed an error in the HistoryPlugin that caused the same request and response
  to be logged multiple times when an HTTP protocol error occurs.
* Ensuring that cURL does not add a default Content-Type when no Content-Type
  has been supplied by the user. This prevents the adapter layer from modifying
  the request that is sent over the wire after any listeners may have already
  put the request in a desired state (e.g., signed the request).
* Throwing an exception when you attempt to send requests that have the
  "stream" set to true in parallel using the MultiAdapter.
* Only calling curl_multi_select when there are active cURL handles. This was
  previously changed and caused performance problems on some systems due to PHP
  always selecting until the maximum select timeout.
* Fixed a bug where multipart/form-data POST fields were not correctly
  aggregated (e.g., values with "&").

## 4.1.6 - 2014-08-03

* Added helper methods to make it easier to represent messages as strings,
  including getting the start line and getting headers as a string.

## 4.1.5 - 2014-08-02

* Automatically retrying cURL "Connection died, retrying a fresh connect"
  errors when possible.
* cURL implementation cleanup
* Allowing multiple event subscriber listeners to be registered per event by
  passing an array of arrays of listener configuration.

## 4.1.4 - 2014-07-22

* Fixed a bug that caused multi-part POST requests with more than one field to
  serialize incorrectly.
* Paths can now be set to "0"
* `ResponseInterface::xml` now accepts a `libxml_options` option and added a
  missing default argument that was required when parsing XML response bodies.
* A `save_to` stream is now created lazily, which means that files are not
  created on disk unless a request succeeds.

## 4.1.3 - 2014-07-15

* Various fixes to multipart/form-data POST uploads
* Wrapping function.php in an if-statement to ensure Guzzle can be used
  globally and in a Composer install
* Fixed an issue with generating and merging in events to an event array
* POST headers are only applied before sending a request to allow you to change
  the query aggregator used before uploading
* Added much more robust query string parsing
* Fixed various parsing and normalization issues with URLs
* Fixing an issue where multi-valued headers were not being utilized correctly
  in the StreamAdapter

## 4.1.2 - 2014-06-18

* See UPGRADING.md for more information on how to upgrade.
* Requests now support the ability to specify an array of $options when creating a request to more easily modify a
  request. You can pass a 'request.options' configuration setting to a client to apply default request options to
  every request created by a client (e.g. default query string variables, headers, curl options, etc.).

  Symfony users can still use the old version of Monolog.
* Fixing BC break: Added the implementation back in for `Guzzle\Http\Message\AbstractMessage::getTokenizedHeader()`.
  Now triggering an E_USER_DEPRECATED warning when used. Use `$message->getHeader()->parseParams()`.
* Several performance improvements to `Guzzle\Common\Collection`
* Added an `$options` argument to the end of the following methods of `Guzzle\Http\ClientInterface`:
  createRequest, head, delete, put, patch, post, options, prepareRequest

## 3.6.0 - 2013-05-29

* ServiceDescription now implements ToArrayInterface
* Added command.hidden_params to blacklist certain headers from being treated as additionalParameters
* Guzzle can now correctly parse incomplete URLs
* Mixed casing of headers are now forced to be a single consistent casing across all values for that header.
* Messages internally use a HeaderCollection object to delegate handling case-insensitive header resolution
* Removed the whole changedHeader() function system of messages because all header changes now go through addHeader().
* Specific header implementations can be created for complex headers. When a message creates a header, it uses a
  HeaderFactory which can map specific headers to specific header classes. There is now a Link header and
  CacheControl header implementation.
* Removed from interface: Guzzle\Http\ClientInterface::setUriTemplate
* Removed from interface: Guzzle\Http\ClientInterface::setCurlMulti()

* Removed cURL blacklist support. This is no longer necessary now that Expect, Accept, etc. are managed by Guzzle
  directly via interfaces
* Removed the injecting of a request object onto a response object. The methods to get and set a request still exist
  but are a no-op until removed.
* Most classes that used to require a `Guzzle\Service\Command\CommandInterface` typehint now request a
  `Guzzle\Service\Command\ArrayCommandInterface`.
* Added `Guzzle\Http\Message\RequestInterface::startResponse()` to the RequestInterface to handle injecting a response
  on a request while the request is still being transferred
* The ability to case-insensitively search for header values
* Guzzle\Http\Message\Header::hasExactHeader

* POST requests using a custom entity body are now treated exactly like PUT requests but with a custom cURL method. This
  means that the redirect behavior of POST requests with custom bodies will not be the same as POST requests that use
  POST fields or files (the latter is only used when emulating a form POST in the browser).
* Lots of cleanup to CurlHandle::factory and RequestFactory::createRequest

## 3.3.1 - 2013-03-10

  additional properties also support locations and can be used to parse JSON responses where the outermost part of the
  JSON is an array
* Added support for nested renaming of JSON models (rename sentAs to name)
* CachePlugin
    * Added support for stale-if-error so that the CachePlugin can now serve stale content from the cache on error
    * Debug headers can now added to cached response in the CachePlugin
