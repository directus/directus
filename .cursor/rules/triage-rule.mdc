# Issue Triage Instructions

When asked to estimate or triage a GitHub issue:

## Research Requirements (MANDATORY)

1. **Always do deep research first** - Search the codebase thoroughly to understand the issue
2. **Explain your findings** - Detail what you found, which files are involved, and your reasoning
3. **Distinguish user error from bugs** - Many issues are configuration problems, not Directus bugs
4. **Consider scope** - High priority = impacts ALL users. If it's a config issue or edge case, it's Low/Medium
5. **Check if it's reproducible** - "Works locally but not in production" often means user config issue

## Structured Assessment

## Required Output Format

### Priority
Select ONE: `Urgent` | `High` | `Medium` | `Low`

### Estimate  
Select ONE: `XS` (< 1h) | `S` (1-4h) | `M` (4h-1d) | `L` (1-3d) | `XL` (3d+)

### Labels

**Integration** (if applicable):
MySQL, AWS S3, Azure, Cloudinary, CockroachDB, GCS, Local, MariaDB, MS SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres, SQLite, Supabase

**Type** (select ONE):
Bug, Feature, Improvement, Spike, Task

**Impact** (select ONE):
High Impact, Med Impact, Low Impact

**Product** (select ONE or more):
Core, Docs, Studio (App)

**Core Component** (select relevant):
Assets/Files, Auth, Comments, Content Comparison, Content Workflow, CRUD, Data Modeling, Emailing, Extensions, Flows, GraphQL, Infra, Insights, Integrations, Logs, Monetization, Observability, Onboarding, Permissions, Presets, Sharing, Telemetry, UX/DX, Validation, Versioning

**Enterprise**: Yes/No (if it requires enterprise features)

## Example Output

```
📋 TRIAGE SUMMARY
─────────────────
Priority:    Medium
Estimate:    S (1-4h)

Labels:
├─ Integration:     MySQL
├─ Type:            Bug
├─ Impact:          Med Impact
├─ Product:         Core
├─ Core Component:  Infra
└─ Enterprise:      No
```

## Issue Comment

Also provide a short, natural comment ready to paste on the issue. This comment should:
- Be written like a developer writing quickly to help a colleague
- NO formal structure, NO headers, NO bullet points lists
- Straight to the point: what's the problem, where is it, how to fix it
- Include file paths and line numbers when relevant
- Mention if other integrations/DBs are affected or not
- Sound human, not like ChatGPT

**Good example:**
```
Quick look at this - the issue is in `api/src/migrations/xxx.ts` around line 45. 
It does X then Y which breaks when Z is enabled.

Fix should be simple: do X and Y in a single statement for MySQL. We already 
have this pattern in other migrations.

Only affects MySQL 8+ with this specific setting, other DBs are fine.
```

**Bad example (too ChatGPT):**
```
## Investigation Summary
**Root Cause**: The migration executes...
**Suggested Fix**: Implement a conditional...
**Impact Assessment**: This issue affects...
```
