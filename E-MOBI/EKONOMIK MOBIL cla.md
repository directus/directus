Monospace Inc. Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement"), v2.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to a Directus project. To clarify the intellectual property rights in the
project and any Contributions, Directus requires that You accept this Contributor License Agreement. This license is for
Your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of Directus, recipients of software distributed or made
available by Directus, and other contributors; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your past, present, and future Contributions submitted to
Monospace Inc. ("Directus"). Except for the licenses granted herein to Directus and the recipients of software
distributed or made available by Directus, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that
   is making this Agreement with Directus. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities
   that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single
   Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or
   more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\
   "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship, invention or improvement, including
   any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Directus for inclusion in,
   or documentation of, any of the projects owned or managed by Directus (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
   "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Directus or its representatives, including
   but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
   that are managed by, or on behalf of, Directus for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
   that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Directus and
   the recipients of software distributed or made available by Directus a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
   publicly perform, make available, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works, as well as the right
   to sublicense and have sublicensed, through multiple tiers of sublicensees, all of the foregoing rights.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Directus and the
   recipients of software distributed or made available by Directus a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
   sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work and Your Contributions, as well as the right to sublicense and have
   sublicensed, through multiple tiers of sublicensees, all of the foregoing rights where such license applies only to
   those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of
   Your Contributions with the Work to which such Contributions were submitted. If any entity institutes patent
   litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
   of Your Contributions, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
   infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed (“Defensive Patent Termination”), provided that the terms
   under which such instituting entity obtained any such patent license provide notice of this Defensive Patent
   Termination.

4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If any third party (such as your employer(s))
   has rights to any portion of any of Your Contributions, you represent that such third party has authorized your
   submission of such Contributions or that such third party has waived such rights for such Contributions.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions of work that
   is not Your original creation).

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support.
   You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, and except for the representations and warranties elsewhere in this Agreement, You provide Your
   Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
   including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit, along with any of Your Contributions, work that is not Your original creation (“Third
   Party Work”), You represent that You have sufficient rights in such Third Party Work to make the submission and may
   submit it to Directus separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any
   license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) and
   conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here] and licensed pursuant to:
   [license name]" (substituting the bracketed text with the applicable information).

8. You agree to notify Directus of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make the
   representations contained herein inaccurate in any respect.

9. Your Contribution and any personal information contained therein and otherwise provided to Directus may be maintained
   indefinitely and may be redistributed or made available consistent with this Agreement. The personal information you
   provide will be maintained in accordance with Directus’ privacy policy.
