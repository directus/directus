## üéØ Overview

Integrated Codex's comprehensive review and created **14 new GitHub issues** organized into **5 Epics** based on the updated requirements.

---

## üìã Epic Structure

### Epic 1: Workflow Model Overhaul
**Goal:** Improve car workflow with enriched statuses and automatic transitions

| Issue | Title | Priority | Time |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| [#6](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/6) | Add enriched statuses with colors/translations | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | 6h |
| [#7](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/7) | Automatic status transitions in hook | ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH | 8h |

**Status Flow:**
```
registered ‚Üí booking ‚Üí workshop_received ‚Üí tech_completed ‚Üí
cosmetic_completed ‚Üí quality_check ‚Üí ready_for_delivery ‚Üí delivered
                        ‚Üì
                  qc_failed, waiting_parts (branches)
```

**Auto-Transitions:**
- `workshop_received_at` set ‚Üí `workshop_received`
- Tech + Cosmetic done ‚Üí `quality_check`
- Quality approved ‚Üí `ready_for_delivery`
- `delivered_at` set ‚Üí `delivered` (terminal, locked)

---

### Epic 2: Notification & Automation
**Goal:** Smart notifications using Flows and OpenAI

| Issue | Title | Priority | Time |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| [#8](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/8) | Flows for key events (arrival, QC, delivery, overdue) | ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH | 12h |

**Events:**
1. Arrival - car reaches workshop
2. QC Result - quality check pass/fail
3. Ready for Delivery - car ready
4. Overdue Reminder - delivery_date tomorrow
5. Parts Arrived - waiting_parts ‚Üí in_stock

**Implementation:**
- Trigger: Event Hook (status change)
- Email: Resend API
- In-app: Notifications collection
- Optional: OpenAI for smart summaries

---

### Epic 3: UX & Dashboards
**Goal:** Role-based UX and AI-powered queries

| Issue | Title | Priority | Time |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| [#9](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/9) | Role-based forms (show only relevant fields) | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | 8h |
| [#10](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/10) | "Ask Cars" module (OpenAI natural language) | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | 16h |

**Role-Based Forms:**

| Role | Shows | Hides |
|------|-------|-------|
| Booking | regnr, vin, customer, dates | tech_*, cosmetic_*, price |
| Workshop Tech | tech_*, parts, hours | customer, cosmetic_*, price |
| Workshop Cosmetic | cosmetic_*, materials | tech_*, customer, price |
| Quality | quality_*, approval | customer, price |
| Sales | price, sold_*, delivery | tech_*, cosmetic_*, quality_* |

**Ask Cars Examples:**
- "Show me all Audis ready this week"
- "Which cars are overdue?"
- "List cars waiting for parts at Gumpen"

---

### Epic 4: Brand Presets & Auto-Archiving
**Goal:** Per-dealership branding and automatic archiving

| Issue | Title | Priority | Time |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| [#11](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/11) | Dealership branding (colors/logo) with CSS vars | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | 12h |
| [#12](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/12) | Auto-archive delivered cars; block edits | ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH | 6h |

**Brand Colors:**
- **Audi:** Primary #BB0A30 (red), Secondary #000000 (black)
- **Skoda:** Primary #4BA82E (green), Secondary #000000
- **Nissan:** Primary #C3002F (red), Secondary #000000
- **Gumpen:** Primary #1E3A8A (blue), Secondary #F59E0B (amber)

**Auto-Archiving:**
- Trigger: `delivered_at` set OR `status = 'delivered'`
- Action: Set `status = 'archived'`
- Effect: Read-only (block all edits)

---

### Epic 5: Common Vehicle Bank & Daily Enrichment
**Goal:** Shared vehicle pool with automatic data enrichment

| Issue | Title | Priority | Time |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| [#13](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/13) | Add in_vehicle_bank + visibility model | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | 10h |
| [#14](https://github.com/gumpen-app/directapp/issues/14) | Daily enrichment Flow using vehicle-lookup | ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH | 12h |

**Visibility Levels:**
- **Private:** Only my dealership
- **Brand:** All dealerships of same brand (Audi sees Audi from other locations)
- **Global:** All dealerships

**Daily Enrichment (03:00 cron):**
1. Find cars with missing: VIN, regnr, make, model, year
2. Call `/vehicle-lookup` endpoint
3. Update only empty fields (preserve user data)
4. Log to `enrichment_logs` collection
5. Rate limit: 100 cars/run, 1s delay between requests

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### From Codex's Review:

1. **Keep invariants in hook** (authoritative)
   - Automatic transitions
   - Terminal state locking
   - Archive protection

2. **Use Flows for side-effects**
   - Notifications
   - Logging
   - External API calls

3. **Separate concerns:**
   - `status` = workflow state
   - `archived` = separate (or use Directus archive_field)
   - Don't mix workflow and archive

4. **Security:**
   - All filters: `dealership_id = $CURRENT_USER.dealership_id`
   - Brand sharing: `dealership.brand = $CURRENT_USER.dealership.brand`
   - Rate limiting on AI queries
   - Sanitized logs (no PII)

5. **Enrichment:**
   - Idempotent (safe to re-run)
   - Never overwrite non-empty user fields
   - Log all actions
