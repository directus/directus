        Hi, thank you for taking the time to create a feature request!

        In order to make sure this feature request has the biggest chance of being implemented, please fill out the following sections in as much detail as you can.

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Summary
      description: Brief explanation of the feature
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Basic Example
      description: If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example.

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Motivation
      description: |
        Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

        Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Detailed Design
      description: |
        This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with Directus to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

      label: Drawbacks
      description: |
        Why should we **not** do this? Please consider:
          - implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
          - whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
          - the impact on teaching people Directus
          - integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
          - cost of migrating existing Directus applications (is it a breaking change?)

          There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.
