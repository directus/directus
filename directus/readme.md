## 📄 Understanding Our License

Directus is licensed under [the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1](./license) with a permissive additional use grant.
For most users, it operates just like open source! Here's what that means for you:

### Free for Most Users

If your organization has less than $5M in annual revenue and/or funding combined, you can use Directus freely in any way
you'd like. Build that side project, launch your startup, or experiment with the platform — no strings attached.

### Enterprise Usage

For larger organizations (>$5M in annual revenue/funding) using Directus in production, we require a commercial license.
This model helps us maintain a sustainable balance: keeping Directus free for the majority of our community while
ensuring larger organizations who benefit from the platform contribute to its continued development.

### Why This Approach?

We believe in making powerful data tools accessible to everyone. This license lets us:

- Keep Directus free for individuals, startups, and smaller companies
- Maintain active development and strong support
- Continue improving the platform for everyone
- Stay sustainable as an independent project
