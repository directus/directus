✨ GEN-1057 — Enhance Flow Log Overview with Status Indicators and Filtering 🧠📊
Improved the visibility and usability of flow logs in the Sidebar Detail component.

🔍 What’s new:
Status icons (success/failed) now appear directly in the log list — no need to click into each log to see what happened
✅❌

Inline filter added to toggle and view only failed logs, making it easier to troubleshoot flows quickly ⚙️🔍

🎯 Why this matters:
This enhancement makes it faster and easier to scan through flow execution history, especially when tracking down failed
runs. You now get instant visual feedback on what succeeded and what didn’t — right from the sidebar.

📁 Files touched:
app/src/modules/settings/routes/flows/components/logs-sidebar-detail.vue

🚀 A small step for the UI, a big leap for DX!
