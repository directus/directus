/**
 * TusLocker is an implementation of the Locker interface that manages locks in memory or using Redis.
 * This class is designed for exclusive access control over resources, often used in scenarios like upload management.
 *
 * Locking Behavior:
 * - When the `lock` method is invoked for an already locked resource, the `cancelReq` callback is called.
 *   This signals to the current lock holder that another process is requesting the lock, encouraging them to release it as soon as possible.
 * - The lock attempt continues until the specified timeout is reached. If the timeout expires and the lock is still not
 *   available, an error is thrown to indicate lock acquisition failure.
 *
 * Lock Acquisition and Release:
 * - The `lock` method implements a wait mechanism, allowing a lock request to either succeed when the lock becomes available,
 *   or fail after the timeout period.
 * - The `unlock` method releases a lock, making the resource available for other requests.
