Directus
====================

**[Learn more at GetDirectus.com](http://getdirectus.com)**

Welcome to Directus, a free and open-source headless CMS written in Backbone.js that provides a feature-rich environment for rapid development and management of custom database schemas. Directus makes no assumptions about how you should architect your schema – giving you the freedom to tailor the database to your specific project needs and provide an intuitive, one-to-one interface to your users. And instead of encompassing your entire project, Directus focuses on a lightweight core suite designed to integrate with the frameworks already in your workflow.

NGINX or Apache Server, PHP 5.5+, MySQL 5.2+, PDO_MySQL, Mod_Rewrite, CURL, GD Library, mcrypt — and optionally: Imagick


## Versioning ##
For transparency and insight into our release cycle, releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

_For more information on semantic versioning, please visit [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/)._


## Database Types ##
While Directus has been abstracted to allow for different database adapters in the future, currently only MySQL is supported. We hope that as we gain additional contributors we can expand Directus to support additional database types.
